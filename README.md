  Basically the project is about detecting depression using EEG signals
  The utilization of EEG signals and the MNE (MNE-Python) library for mental depression 
detection represents a promising avenue in the field of neurobiological research. The MNE library 
provides a robust and flexible framework for preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing EEG data, 
enabling researchers to delve into the intricate neural dynamics associated with depression.
